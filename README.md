Download the mod from the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/UPSFriendlyNixieTubeDisplay).

## Features

- Chain multiple Nixie Tubes to display large numbers
- Supports negative numbers
- Has a simple GUI to choose the signal
- Performance improvements
  - It doesn't rerender numbers that haven't changed
  - It doesn't use tanks as sprites for the numbers, so it will even show up nice on the mini map
  - It doesn't use characters for colors, so no ups drops from lots of characters on the map
  - No colors (Nixies are orange from the heated filament)

## Usage

1) Research the respective technologies (Classic Nixie Tubes, Reinforced Nixie Tubes)
2) Place one or multiple Nixie Tubes in a row to display larger numbers
